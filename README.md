# React Portfolio

## Description
This is an update of [my earlier portfolio](https://github.com/s2robertson/portfolio) that uses React to drive page navigation and manage a contact form.

## Usage
The app can be started from a development server with `npm start` or built with `npm build`.  In the header, the user can choose between four pages: About (the default), Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.  The About page has a picture of me and a brief bio.  The Portfolio page lists some projects that I've worked on, and has links to the repos and deployed instances of the apps.  The Contact page has a form for requesting contact, though it is not currently connected to a back-end.  Inputs are validated and feedback is provided as the user enters their details.  The Resume page has a link to my resume (hosted on Google Docs) and a list of my proficiencies.

## Credits
I initialized the app with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).  In addition to the packages in `package.json`, I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for some of its styling.  The color scheme was inspired by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/336699-86bbd8-2f4858-9ee493-daf7dc).
